<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Technologies used include HTML, CSS</p>

<h3>In Action:</h3>
<p>User can view the form for registering to become a BBQ master. </p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>Focus and aria-labels are used on form elements for visual effects and to allow screen readers to identify the fields properly. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>In this project, I used CSS media queries to ensure the page adapted to the different viewing sizes of the user. I also used the CSS properties transition and transform to create the visual effects on the form.</p>
